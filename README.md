üîç Sales Summary Report (Using SQLite + Python)

We analyzed a sample sales dataset using Python and SQLite to extract basic yet essential sales metrics. Here are the key highlights:
Total Quantity Sold: 99,067 units
Total Revenue Generated:$8,290,886.79

We used SQL queries within Python to compute these figures from the dataset. The data was first loaded into a pandas DataFrame, written into an in-memory SQLite database, and queried using standard SQL.

To make the insights more accessible, we also visualized the metrics using a **clean and readable bar chart**. The chart:

Shows total quantity and revenue side-by-side
Displays revenue in millions for visual clarity
Includes labels and color coding for better presentation

This simple analysis demonstrates how SQL and Python can be used together to pull and present valuable business insights efficiently.
